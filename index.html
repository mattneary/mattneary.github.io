        <span class="title">Education.</span> I am in my final year at Harvard
        College, studying History &amp; Science and writing a thesis on the
        history of computing in the twentieth century. As part of my degree I
        have also taken many interesting computer science courses on topics
        like Programming Languages, Quantum Computing, and Data Structures
        &amp; Algorithms.
        
        <br /> <br />

        <span class="title">Employment.</span> My first job was as a software
        engineer at <a href="https://www.kenexis.com">Kenexis</a>,
        working on their software tools for chemical engineering projects.
        While there I overhauled the platform to
        do risk analysis on uploaded CAD models rather than require manual
        input of the layout and contents of a facility. I then implemented
        interactive, full 3d visualization of the results in the browser.
        <br />
        <span class="title"></span> During my college years I have worked at
        <a href="https://www.kensho.com">Kensho</a>
        for a total of more than three years, working full-time for three
        semesters and four summers. At Kensho I worked as a full-stack engineer
        and led the development of our second generation analytics product. The
        product, called Kensho Sheets, was used by our internal financial research
        team and clients at some of the largest banks in the world. It aimed to
        bring data science and machine learning techniques to non-programmers
        working on Wall Street.
        
        <br /> <br />

        <span class="title">Projects.</span> I have many open source
        projects on Github. Some of my favorites
        are <a href="http://mimesis.is">Mimesis</a>&mdash;a command line
        screencaster&mdash;and
        <a href="http://github.com/mattneary/command-t">command-t</a>&mdash;a
        custom New Tab page for chrome that lets you search your unfortunately
        large number of open tabs and switch to them, accessible by a single
        keystroke. I also designed
        <a href="http://github.com/mattneary/concrete">concrete</a> and for the
        first time felt I had decoupled the weirdness of parsers from the code
        needed to define one.
